## Stack Exchange Editor Extra
A userscript which adds extra features to the default SE Markdown Editor.

Extra features:

- Insert *code* with Ace Editor (<kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>a</kbd>)
- Find & Replace (with modifiers) (<kbd>alt</kbd>+ <kbd>f</kbd>)
- KBD-ify selected text (<kbd>alt</kbd>+ <kbd>k</kbd>)
- Auto correct (very basic)
- <kbd>Tab</kbd> key indents rather than moves focus
- Side by side editing (for new questions/new answers only)
- Improved link insertion: auto search via DuckDuckGo allows you to easily link to popular websites
- Improved image insertion: add a smaller image with a link to a bigger one or just the plain image

## Usage

The image & link dialogs are simply replaced - clicking the normal icon will show the new one. For all other features, a small toolbar is added:

## Install

- You'll need a userscript manager such as [Greasemonkey](http://www.greasespot.net/) (for Firefox) or [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/) (for Chrome). 
- <kbd>[Install]()</kbd> or <kbd>[View source]()</kbd>
- I've only tested on Chrome so far...
