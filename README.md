# Stack-Exchange-Editor-Pro
A userscript that replaces the default SE markdown editor with an enhanced, easier to use markdown editor

# To Do:

- [x] add links:
  
  - direct links
  - auto search via DuckDuckGo

- [x] add images:

  - direct images
  - images that can be clicked on to open it in a new tab, bigger
  
- [x] find and replace:

  - own find term, own modifier, own replace term

- [ ] ? autocorrect (will be the hardest part):

  - possible regexes to change content
  
- [x] better usage of <kbd>TAB</kbd> key:

  - pressing should indent rather than move on
  
- [x] code editor (probably Ace editor):

  - autocomplete editor that can insert code to the post
